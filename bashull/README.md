# Bashull Directory

This directory is reserved for content from the Bashull/Bashull repository.

## Purpose
This subdirectory was created to house files and content from the [Bashull/Bashull](https://github.com/Bashull/Bashull) repository.

## Status
The source repository (Bashull/Bashull) is currently empty. When content is added to that repository, it can be merged here while preserving commit history using:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix=bashull bashull-repo <branch> --squash
```

Or to preserve full history:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix=bashull bashull-repo <branch>
```

## Notes
- This directory structure follows the requirement to merge the Bashull/Bashull repository into a `bashull` subdirectory
- Commit history preservation will be maintained when content is available in the source repository
